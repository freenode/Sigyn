# Sigyn

A Limnoria plugin to handle spam and abuse on a network level.

Sigyn is developed primarily for the freenode irc network. As with most of
freenode's utility bots, Sigyn is named after a
[Norse goddess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigyn).

## Installation

If you're running this on a production network, you should probably use the
latest stable release. The master branch is considered unstable and may break at
any time.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/freenode/Sigyn/wiki) for setup instructions
and commands, as well as a work-in-progress configuration manual.

## Requesting Sigyn to your channel

The best way is to discuss with a staffer, you could also ask for her presence temporary ( duration varies ), with an /invite Sigyn ( reviewed by staff ).

But as invite notification can be missed, feel free to join #freenode-sigyn and ask in there.

If opped in your channel you can ask Sigyn to unkline an user, /msg Sigyn unkline <nick>, you have a dozen minutes to do so after the kill/kline, it only works if the user was banned due to abuse detected in your channel.
